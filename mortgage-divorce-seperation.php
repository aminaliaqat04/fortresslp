                            <p class="description">Splitting up with a partner can be one of the most trying periods of your life, and the emotional upheaval can be compounded by the logistics of dividing a major asset such as a home. The financial realities associated with new home ownership after a separation can be just as frustrating.</p>

We take a collaborative approach with clients so they understand the fine print with each mortgage product available to them. We will present a variety of options to clients, and work with them to decide on the best products for their needs, based on qualification.</p>
