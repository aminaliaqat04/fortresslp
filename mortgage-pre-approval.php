                            <p class="description">A mortgage pre-approval is an important step in the home buying process and we can help you out. We can help with your financial strategy, your mortgage amount, down payment amount, purchase price and give you an overall idea of what you can realistically afford.</p>
                            <p class="description">We will advise you about the documentation (income confirmation, down payment confirmation, etc.) you'll need to supply upon conditional approval of your mortgage. Any conditions must be met for your mortgage to be fully approved. Pre-approvals are subject to your continued good credit and are usually good for 60, 90 or 120 days depending on the lender.</p>
