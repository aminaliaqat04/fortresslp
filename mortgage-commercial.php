The participants in this market are chartered banks, credit unions, life insurance companies, mortgage investment companies, and non-institutional companies. Each have a unique portfolio structure, pricing matrix, and appetite for specific products and industries, so it's important to seek the advice of a Mortgage Consultant to ensure that your requirements are satisfied.</p>
