                            <p class="description">We see all kinds of credit ratings every day and there are strategies to help improve and even heal damaged credit. You may be surprised to know that you can still obtain a mortgage. Whether you've had a bankruptcy or your credit is only slightly bruised, you can still obtain financing.</p>
                            <p class="description">We have access to non-traditional lenders who offer financing solutions to individuals who have some credit challenges that cannot be addressed by the major financial institutions. Together we can quickly assess your situation and decide on the best way to move forward. The worst you can do is do nothing.</p>
