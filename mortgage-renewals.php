                            <p class="description">If your mortgage renewal is fast approaching, then now is a great time to look at the many excellent options and competitive rates available. Lenders send out renewal forms just prior to renewal dates to those with good payment histories, with about 70% of homeowners sending it back without asking any questions! In todayâ€™s hectic world, that can be the easiest and best route, but you should ask yourself some questions before you sign on the dotted line. This is an important moment of opportunity. This is where an independent mortgage professional like us can help offer advice and options to help you get ahead!</p>
                            <p class="description">Maybe your mortgage needs have changed. This is the time to decide. For example, you may want to consolidate high interest debt in with your mortgage or you may want to tap some of your home equity for a renovation project? Or maybe you are considering a cottage or vacation property? Are you confident you will get the best rate at renewal?</p>
                            <p class="description">Having multiple lenders compete for your business is a great way to ensure you get the best rate for your situation. We deal with multiple lending institutions, including major banks, credit unions, trusts and other national and regional lenders, which means significant negotiating power behind finding the best mortgage to fit your specific situation.</p>
